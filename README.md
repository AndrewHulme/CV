## <a name="about_me">About Me</a>

A highly motivated software developer, recently trained at Makers Academy.

I graduated with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Bristol where I was first introduced to the world of coding. After university I worked in the engineering sphere for several years, building on a number of competencies such as problem solving, communication, leadership and team working skills. I am now keen to apply this wealth of skills and experience to a new-found passion in software development.

## <a name="soft-skills">Soft Skills</a>

#### Team Player

- Involved in team projects through my Mechanical Engineering degree, engineering consultancies, Makers Academy and university societies.
- Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Champion for Ramboll, and organised over 20 CPDs for external companies to provide talks to the firm. This gave value to the team by improving our engineering knowledge, awarding points towards chartership and providing free food! Furthermore, I implemented a system for future champions to use when organising CPDs.
- Implemented a rotating leadership scheme and emotional check-ins in a Makers Academy group project when there was disparity between some team members. As a result, we worked more efficiently and together delivered a high quality project to the deadline.

#### Communication
- Presented the final project for Makers Academy, which can be seen [here (4 minute mark)](https://lnkd.in/dk9HyWh).
- As the University of Bristol Campus Consultant for Rolls Royce, Accenture and EDF Energy I promoted the companies through presenting in lecture theatres to 150 or more STEM students at once. This resulted in hundreds of students attending the events and workshops.
